RMI
===

A goland implementation of a RMI ([Recursive Model Indexes](https://github.com/learnedsystems/RMI)), 
a Learned Index structure based on the [research work by Kraska & al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208)

## features

- [ ] A learned index structure using linear regression fitted on keys of type float
- [ ] learning on integer
- [ ] a two layer recursive index
- [ ] a sort algorythm using learned structure
- [ ] recursive indexes with topdown approarch
- [ ] learning on string type
