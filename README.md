![Go](https://github.com/BenJoyenConseil/learned_index/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

A goland implementation of a RMI ([Recursive Model Indexes](https://github.com/learnedsystems/RMI)), 
a Learned Index structure based on the [research work by Kraska & al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208)

## usage

Create an index and make lookups

	// load the age column and parse values into float64 values
	ageColumn := extractAgeColumn("data/people.csv")

	// create an index over the age column
	index := index.New(ageColumn)

	// search an age and get back its line position inside the file people.csv
	search, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(os.Args[1], 64)
	lines, _ := index.Lookup(search)

the `main.go` file contains an example of a learned index over`data/people.csv` age column. 

It outputs : 

	$ cat data/people.csv
	name,age,sex
	jeanne,90,F
	jean,23,M
	Carlos,3,M
	Carlotta,45,F
	Miguel,1,M
	Martine,1.5,F
	Georgette,23,F

    $ go run main.go 45
	2020/11/15 20:29:56 People who are 23 years old are located at [8 3] inside data/people.csv 

This is the plot showing the approximation (the linear regression), the cumulative distribution function for each value,
and the current age's value (the Keys of the index) :
